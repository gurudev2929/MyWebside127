      <h2>Hidden Gem from Ujjani Dam - Palasnath Temple</h2>
      <p>
        Palasnath Temple was on my list from the last 3 years. Temple is 
        located in the backwater of Ujjani Dam and people are only able 
        to visit the temple in case of heavy drought. For rest of the time, 
        it is submerged under the backwater of Ujjani Dam. Temple was accessible 
        in the year 2016 but I missed to visit the temple. I was praying that
         temple should remain in my wishlist forever but unfortunately, 2019 
         drought opened the temple for Visit.

        Ujjani Dam is built on Bhima river hence it is also known as Bhima Dam.
         Dam's construction began in the year 1969 and completed 1980. The

      <h2>Best Time to Visit Palasdeo Lake for Bird Watching</h2>
      <p>
        A flamboyance of flamingos is busy feeding in the shallows. 
        The birds stand on lanky legs; their necks are bent low to the water, 
        beaks upside-down. It is a scattered flock of 16 birds. While some are 
        adults with white and orange feathers, others are young birds with a cream and brown coat. 
        When the water
         levels are right, many more of these birds are found here. 
         They gather in their hundreds, sometimes thousands.

      </p>
      <p>The best time to visit the Bhigwan Bird Sanctuary is from November to March. 
        At Bhigwan Lake you can spot as many as 50 bird species on any given day. 

        Flamingos flock here in large numbers, if you wish to spot the flamingo species,
         you should plan your visit when the water level is low. As the water level increases 
         in the reservoir, the Flamingos shift to other shallow lakes. </p>
